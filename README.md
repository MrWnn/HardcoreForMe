Thinking about how to grep web info from internet through the curl tool?
very first step:
curl [website] > [file]
and then 
cat [file] |  grep something | awk or cut to filter | sed to clear the trash 
and then get this result to [file 2]
and i can get some info such as stock info on http://stock.quote.stockstar.com/XXXXXX.shtml 

but stiil  remain some question like grep things on search engine result...
