Thinking about a messure that deal one thing ont time 
create a dealer ,work for ont thing

many different dealers ,wok together to make one big thing up.

 the symbols:"+ - × ÷ = ! ()"
 
1+1=2

1+1!=1

1+1×2=3

(1+3)÷2=2

one symbol do one thing

make them together to create a new result.

Thinking about how to grep web info from internet through the curl tool?

very first step:

curl [website] > [file]

and then 

cat [file] |  grep something | awk or cut to filter | sed to clear the trash 

and then get this result to [file 2]

and i can get some info such as stock info on http://stock.quote.stockstar.com/XXXXXX.shtml 

but stiil  remain some question like grep things on search engine result...
